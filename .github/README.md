# 🚀 Agitation Pressure Drive (APD)

**The world’s first pressure-based propulsion system powered by tribrid fluid agitation.**  
Invented by [Ricky Foster (Symbiote-001)](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster), this open-engine platform enables motion through pressure pulses generated by cavitation, phase-change, magnetic fields, and ultrasonic vibration.

## 🌟 What Is APD?

The **Agitation Pressure Drive** is a clean-tech propulsion system built around the principle of **multi-state pressure cycles**. By dynamically agitating a mix of liquids, gases, and micro-solids, APD creates directional thrust **without combustion, pistons, or wheels**.
